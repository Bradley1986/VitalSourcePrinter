# VitalSourcePrinter
Code to legally and automatically print your purchased e-books from VitalSource.com

To get started you are going to need a working version of Python 3 because as of this time the only working script is written in Python.

If you're just installing Python 3 for the first time or reinstalling it, I highly recommend using Python 3.4.0 or higher as this version contains a feature called pip that easily allows you to install approved third party packages not included with Python by default. To find more information about pip, visit: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip 

You're also going to need the VitalSource Bookshelf software, which you can find at: https://support.vitalsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/201344733-Bookshelf-Download-Page
